==============

A (maybe too) simple tinypng.org API caller.

It will compress images on execution directory and subdirectories.

Every compressed image is saved in an output directory with folder structure replicated from execution directory.

It will also copy .jpg,.jpeg,.gif,.bmp,.tiff,.tga files to the output.
